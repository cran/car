Companion to Applied Regression
}
\description{
This package accompanies J. Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion
to Applied Regression, Sage, 2002. The package contains mostly
functions for applied regression, linear models, and
generalized linear models, with an emphasis on regression
diagnostics, particularly graphical diagnostic methods. There
are also some utility functions. With some exceptions, I have
tried not to duplicate capabilities in the basic distribution
of R, nor in widely used packages. Where relevant, the
functions in car are consistent with na.action = na.omit or
na.exclude.
